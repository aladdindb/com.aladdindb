## The magically passionate relationship 🥰

Dear friends, 

**AladdinDB** is a completely new, purely **Object-Oriented Database-System for Java** applications. 

Knowing that **AladdinDB** will be one of the best **Object-Oriented Database-System for Java**, I spend my days and nights incessantly developing it ;-) 

**AladdinDB** isn't all about access times and security.
It is also about to be able to **Juggle Around with Data in a Free and Playful Way**.

I hope that programming database applications with **Aladdin will be a lot more fun**.

## Three-dimensional data structures :electron:

Equivalent to **Data-Records** in classic **Relational-Database-Systems**, so-called `Units` in **AladdinDB** form the smallest, separately stored data units. 

In contrast to **Data-Records**, `Units` can map three-dimensional data structures. 

Such structures are described in **AladdinDB**, purely **Object-Oriented**, using `DataModel` classes and saved as `XML` documents.

>Here is an example of a `Unit`

```xml

<Unit version="1.0" id="1560700320d1b71b220">
    <Meta>
        <UnitLabel/>
        <TimeStamp generatedOn="2021-06-07T00:50:13.454866+03:00[Europe/Istanbul]" modifiedOn="2021-06-07T00:50:13.454866+03:00[Europe/Istanbul]"/>

## As free as a bird 🕊️

`Units` of the same `DataModel` types have their origin in corresponding **repositoris**.

`Stores` are completely independent storage units and can be distributed across any storage media and locations at the same time.

In **embedded** systems you can easily access "stores" via `Store` objects. 

Each `Store` object is its own **Micro-Database-System**.
