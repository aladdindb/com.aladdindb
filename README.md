## AladdinDB

Dear friends, 

**AladdinDB** is a completely new, purely **Object-Oriented Database-System for Java** applications. 

Knowing that **AladdinDB** will be one of the best **Object-Oriented Database-System for Java**, I spend my days and nights incessantly developing it ;-) 

**AladdinDB** isn't all about access times and security.
It is also about to be able to **Juggle Around with Data in a Free and Playful Way**.

I hope that programming database applications with **Aladdin will be a lot more fun**.
